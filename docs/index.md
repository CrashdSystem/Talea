# Taleä System Documentation

## Literate Implementation

Here lies the literate implementation of the emulator that acts as documentation for both the system architecture of Taleä and its emulator: [Taleä System Emulator](book/index.html)

## Compilation & Installation

The installation and compilation process should be fairly simple, providing the libraries in the `include` directory are those of your OS. Check the Makefile for further information, but `make talea` should do. If you want to install it permanently in your system, move the executable to a directory in your `PATH`.
