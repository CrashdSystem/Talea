# TALLUM: Taleä Language Layer for Universal Machines

TALLUM is a backend and abstract VM architecture aimed to the Taleä Computer system, but machine agnostic in nature.

It specifies and implements a simple stack machine based on the one presented in Nand2Tetris.
Currently, the only frontends compatible with this implementation are compilers for the JACK
programming language.
