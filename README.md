# The Tale채 Computer System

## *A Fantasy Computer for a Fantasy World*

This is the specification for one of the two families of computers that exist in the fantasy world of *Nar Naellan* (the other one is the [Machine of the Archive of Arkade](about:blank) *not yet even designed*).

It is a fantasy computer heavily inspired in the first IBM PC. It is
used in a fantasy world, and was designed to serve every need that may arise
to any successful merchant business across the sea.

It belongs to the family of Tale채 architectures, and stands as the most powerful system
for consumers in its range. It shares it's architecture and instruction set with whe less
powerful Tale채 Codex.

Tale채 Tabula uses a 16-bit processor, clocked at almost 10Mhz, that can adress up to 16Mb of memory. The
system features an 640x400 256 color screen, a printer style teletype, a keyboard, and a
32 Mb disk.

It's main purpose is, opposed to that of the Machine of the Archive of Arkade, accounting and basic data processing, to be used in commerce and banking by merchants and companies of Talandel. It is cheaper and smaller than the one in the Academy, and a net of these standard machines, once tested, has begun spreading over the city and some of its colonies.

## About this Emulator

The emulator is implemented in C, following the [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm with [Literate](https://zyedidia.github.io/literate/index.html), as should be for a literary machine. The only dependencies so far are [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [Inprint](https://github.com/driedfruit/SDL_inprint). It *should* compile and run on all major OSes with support for SDL2.

## Changelog

Since the last commit nearly a year ago this project is indeed a completely different one. It has retained only the history and the name.
